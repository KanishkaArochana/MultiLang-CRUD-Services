# Database Context Configuration for Employee Table

## Purpose of This Page

### Database Context Definition
The class `EmployeeDbContext` represents a session with the database. It allows your application to interact with the database using Entity Framework Core. It acts as a bridge between your application code and the database.

### Mapping Models to Database Tables
The `DbSet<Employee>` property represents the Employees table in the database. Each model class (like `Employee`) maps to a corresponding database table, and the `DbContext` manages this mapping.

### Configuration Injection
The constructor accepts `DbContextOptions<EmployeeDbContext>`, which allows you to provide configuration settings (like connection strings, logging, etc.) from outside this class. This enables flexible configuration and ensures the database connection details are handled separately.

### Centralized Management
This class centralizes the logic for managing your database entities. All database operations, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting Employee records, are routed through this context.

### Entity Framework Core Integration
By inheriting from `DbContext`, this class gains access to all the functionality provided by Entity Framework Core, such as LINQ-to-SQL translation, change tracking, and migrations.

## Why It’s Necessary

### Ease of Use
Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you can use LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to perform operations on your data in a type-safe and database-independent way.

### Maintainability
Abstracts away database details, making your code easier to maintain and more modular.

### Scalability
If you add more tables (e.g., Departments or Projects), you can extend this `DbContext` to include those tables, creating a single point of control for the database schema.

### Dependency Injection
It integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core's dependency injection system, allowing you to inject this `DbContext` into your services or controllers wherever it’s needed.

## Code Breakdown

### `using backend.Models;`

This line imports the `backend.Models` namespace.
It allows the current file to access and use the `Employee` model or any other classes defined in the `backend.Models` namespace.

### `using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;`

This line imports the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.
It provides access to Entity Framework Core functionality, such as `DbContext` and related database interaction features.

### `namespace api.data`

Defines the namespace `api.data`.
Namespaces are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts. This namespace groups all data-related classes for the API.

### `public class EmployeeDbContext : DbContext`

Declares the `EmployeeDbContext` class, which inherits from `DbContext`.
`DbContext` is a base class provided by Entity Framework Core to manage database connections and operations.
`EmployeeDbContext` is a specialized class used to interact with the database, focusing on the `Employee` model.

### `public EmployeeDbContext(DbContextOptions<EmployeeDbContext> options) : base(options)`

Defines a constructor for the `EmployeeDbContext` class.
Accepts `DbContextOptions<EmployeeDbContext>` as a parameter, allowing configuration of the context, such as connection strings or database providers.
The `: base(options)` part passes the options to the base `DbContext` constructor, enabling it to use the provided configuration.

### `public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }`

Declares a `DbSet` property for the `Employee` model.
`DbSet<Employee>` represents the `Employees` table in the database.
This property enables querying, adding, updating, and deleting operations for `Employee` entities in the database.

## Additional Notes

### Purpose of `EmployeeDbContext`

This class acts as a bridge between the application and the database. It maps the `Employee` class to the `Employees` table and provides methods to interact with it.

### Where It’s Used

Typically, this class is registered in the dependency injection container in the `Startup` class (or `Program.cs` in newer .NET versions). It’s then injected wherever database operations are required.
