# Employee Class
The `Employee` class represents the structure of the Employee table in the database. It defines the following fields:

- **ID (Primary Key)**: An integer (`int`) that serves as the unique identifier for each employee.
- **Name**: A nullable string (`String?`) representing the employee's name.
- **Age**: A nullable string (`String?`) used to represent the employee's age, allowing flexibility for different formats or unknown values.
- **IsActive**: A nullable integer (`int?`) used as a flag to indicate whether the employee is active (e.g., 1 for active, 0 for inactive).

This class uses auto-implemented properties (`{ get; set; }`) for encapsulating fields and adheres to common practices for mapping database tables to C# objects in backend development. The `Employee` class acts as a model in the backend, likely used with an ORM (e.g., Entity Framework) for interacting with the Employee database table.

## Code Breakdown
### Namespace Declaration:
```csharp
namespace backend.Models
```
- The `namespace` keyword declares a logical grouping of classes and other types.
- `backend.Models` indicates that this file is part of the "Models" subnamespace under the "backend" namespace, typically used to organize code related to data models in the backend.

### Class Declaration:
```csharp
public class Employee
```
- `public` specifies that the class is accessible from other parts of the application.
- `Employee` is the name of the class representing an employee entity, often used to define a data structure for employees in an application.

### Property: ID
```csharp
public int ID { get; set; }
```
- `public`: The property is accessible from outside the class.
- `int`: The data type of the property, representing an integer value.
- `ID`: The property name, often used as the primary identifier for the employee.
- `{ get; set; }`: An auto-implemented property, allowing for both retrieval (`get`) and assignment (`set`) of the value.

### Property: Name
```csharp
public String? Name { get; set; }
```
- `public`: Accessible from outside the class.
- `String?`: The property is of type `String` and nullable (`?`), meaning it can store either a string value or `null`.
- `Name`: The property name, representing the employee's name.
- `{ get; set; }`: Allows for retrieval and assignment of the value.

### Property: Age
```csharp
public String? Age { get; set; }
```
- `public`: Accessible from outside the class.
- `String?`: The property is of type `String` and nullable (`?`).
- `Age`: The property name, representing the employee's age. While age is generally stored as an integer, using a string allows for additional flexibility, such as representing ranges ("30-40") or "Unknown".
- `{ get; set; }`: Allows for retrieval and assignment of the value.

### Property: IsActive
```csharp
public int? IsActive { get; set; }
```
- `public`: Accessible from outside the class.
- `int?`: The property is of type `int` and nullable (`?`).
- `IsActive`: The property name, often used as a flag to indicate whether the employee is active. Commonly, 1 might represent active and 0 inactive, though nullable allows for an unspecified state.
- `{ get; set; }`: Allows for retrieval and assignment of the value.

### Summary
This class defines an `Employee` model with four properties (`ID`, `Name`, `Age`, `IsActive`). Each property uses standard conventions for encapsulation (`public` access modifier) and nullability where appropriate. The nullable (`?`) types provide flexibility for scenarios where values might not always be present or initialized.
